# MediaMarketplaceWeb Project
This Project is meant to implement the MediaMarketplace software as a web application.  
For that we needed to update and change some thingsfrom the original project.  

##  **<ins> Backend </ins>**  
We need to change the implementation of the Spring backend from the original project.  

## **<ins> Frontend </ins>**  
We will use React as our frontend (instead of JavaFX for desktop aplications).
